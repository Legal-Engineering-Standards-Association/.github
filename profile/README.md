# Legal Engineering Standards Association (LESA)

LESA is a global forum dedicated to defining open, interoperable standards for the future of legal agreements, in a world increasingly shaped by AI, blockchain, and smart systems.

## Mission

Develop robust, open standards and best practices that enable legal agreements to be secure, transparent, machine-readable, and adaptable to emerging technologies.

## Vision

A harmonised, decentralised legal agreement ecosystem where stakeholders—courts, law firms, developers, institutions—operate using shared, future-proof standards.

## Goals

- Establish interoperable legal agreement schemas compatible with AI and blockchain integration.
- Promote modular, extensible, and machine-friendly legal standards.
- Encourage global collaboration across legal experts, technologists, and policymakers.
- Release open-source tools, templates, and reference implementations.
- Identify ways to make robust legal agreements more widely accessible.
